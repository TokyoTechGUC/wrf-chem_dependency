# wrf-chem_dependency
This is a list of bash scripts for installing dependencies to run WRF and WRF-Chem.

Works for version 4.6.

### Bash scripts
This repository contains bash scripts for installing required dependencies in sequence. The user has to replace the sources and the base directories contained in the bash script. The dependencies have been tested in Tsubame 4.0 Supercomputer of the Institute of Science Tokyo.

### Disclaimer
Any issues encountered may possibly be system dependent. Thus, issue response is slow and self-debugging is needed.
